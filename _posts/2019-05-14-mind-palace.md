***Mind Palace*** —also referred to as the memory palace
or [method of loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci)—is a
mnemonic device which uses location-based visualization to help organize or recall information. In simple words, a mind palace is a place so well known to you that you can store large bits of information with relative ease.

In the BBC hit television series [Sherlock](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1475582/), Sherlock Holmes withdraws into his mind palace, seeking clues and mental cues to help solve the Hounds of Baskerville Case.
