**Mission:** I wanted to start publishing my thoughts on a blog again. I already had one hosted on [blogger](https://salilwalavalkar.blogspot.com/) but wanted to try something new. Here were few of my requirements:
- Ability to manage blog data on Github.
- Switch from HTML based to Markdown.
- Static site for better performance.

I stumbled upon [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I found it much easier to manage my blog data with Jekyll than with Wordpress/Blogger. It has a lot of customizations which hopefully I wil discover along the way..
