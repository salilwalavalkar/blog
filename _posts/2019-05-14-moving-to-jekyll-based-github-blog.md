  Transitioning from Blogger to Jekyll, Github

**Mission:** I wanted to start publishing my thoughts on a blog again. I already had one hosted on [blogger](https://salilwalavalkar.blogspot.com/) but wanted to try something new. Here were few of my requirements:
- Ability to manage blog data on Github (Command line FTW).
- Switch from HTML based to Markdown (Improve my markdown in the process).
- Static site for better performance.

I came across [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on the interwebs. I found it much easier to manage my blog data with Jekyll than with Wordpress/Blogger. It has a lot of customizations which hopefully I will discover along the way..
