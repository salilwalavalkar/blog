This question has been asked to me a number of times by different folks over the years. Which one is better ? Someone who has spent significant amount of time at fewer companies/projects vs someone who has worked at many companies/projects over the same duration. There is no clear answer to this question, however this snippet always comes to my mind.

> A novice asked master Banzen: “What separates the monk from the master?”

> Banzen replied: “Ten thousand mistakes!”

> The novice, not understanding, sought to avoid all error. An abbot observed and brought the novice to Banzen for correction.

> Banzen explained: “I have made ten thousand mistakes; Suku has made ten thousand mistakes; the patriarchs of Open Source have each made ten thousand mistakes.”

> Asked the novice: “What of the old monk who labors in the cubicle next to mine? Surely he has made ten thousand mistakes.”

> Banzen shook his head sadly. “Ten mistakes, a thousand times each.”
